Description: Fit linear mixed-effects models using restricted (or residual)
    maximum likelihood (REML) and with generalized inverse matrices to specify
    covariance structures for random effects. In particular, the package is suited
    to fit quantitative genetic mixed models, often referred to as 'animal models' 
    (Kruuk. 2004 <DOI: 10.1098/rstb.2003.1437>). Implements the average
    information algorithm as the main tool to maximize the restricted likelihood,
    but with other algorithms available (Meyer. 1997. Genet Sel Evol 29:97; Meyer
    and Smith. 1998. Genet Sel Evol 28:23.).
